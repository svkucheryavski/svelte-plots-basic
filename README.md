# Svelte components for creating plots

The library is under development and breaking changes may occur in the coming versions.

## News

New major release (v. 2.0.0) introduces many breaking changes as the library was completely re-written. If you use previous versions of `svelte-plots-basic` in your projects, and do not want to change anything, stick to the latest 1.x.x version (v. 1.1.4).

### 2.1.1â€”2.1.4

* Small improvements and bug fixes.

### 2.1.0

* Added new elements, `Heatmap` and `ColormapLegend`.
* Improvements to tick labels, in particular if values are too small (< 0.01) or too large (>99) the values are adjusted and a common factor is shown at the end of axis. This is applied only to automatic ticks, manually provided ticks and tick labels are shown as is.
* Small improvements and bug fixes.

## Description

`svelte-plots-basic` is a [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) component library for creating simple 2D and 3D plots/charts. The plots are created by generating [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) inside HTML document and are re-scalable.

The library provides building blocks for creating plots, one can think of this library as "Lego" bricks for plots. It has two groups of components: for 2D and for 3D plots. In addition to `svelte` the library has one direct dependence, [mdatools-js](https://github.com/svkucheryavski/mdatools-js) library which is used for vector/matrix operations, statistics, and other manipulations with data values.


## Installation

The set up process is similar to any other Svelte component library. Just use:

```
npm -i -D svelte-plots-basic
```

or, to install it with yarn:

```
yarn add -D svelte-plots-basic
```

## Demo

There is on-line demo site with some examples of what you can do with the library: [https://mda.tools/svelteplotsdemo/](https://mda.tools/svelteplotsdemo/). All examples from this demo are available in corresponding GitHub repo: [](). Use code of the examples for inspiration and as a tutorial, although some basic information is also available below.

## Quick start (2D plots)

It is assumed that you already know the basics of Svelte.

Just create a new Svelte app following the [quick start guide](https://svelte.dev/blog/the-easiest-way-to-get-started). Then open `App.svelte` file, delete everything and write the following code, which creates a simple 2D bar chart:

```svelte
<script>
   import {Axes, XAxis, YAxis, Box, BarSeries} from 'svelte-plots-basic';

   // test data for the plot
   const years = [2010, 2020, 2030, 2040, 2050];
   const amount = [100, 200, 150, 300, -100];
</script>

<div class="plot-container">
<Axes limX={[2005, 2055]} limY={[-150, 350]} margins={[1, 1, 0.5, 0.5]}xLabel="Years" yLabel="Income">

      <BarSeries
         faceColor="#e0e0e0"
         edgeColor="#909090"
         xValues={years}
         yValues={amount}
      />

      // x and y axis with automatic ticks and grid lines
      <XAxis slot="xaxis" />
      <YAxis slot="yaxis" />

      // box around the axes
      <Box slot="box" />

   </Axes>
</div>

<style>
   .plot-container {
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
      min-width: 200px;
      min-height: 200px;
   }
</style>
```

Then run `npm run dev` in terminal and open the URL provided by npm in browser. That is it.

You can also use all capabilities of the `mdatools` package, e.g. generated random numbers:

```svelte
<script>
   import { Axes, BarSeries } from 'svelte-plots-basic';
   import { Vector } from 'mdatools/arrays';

   // generate random values from normal distribution
   const x = Vector.randn(200, 0, 1);
   const y = Vector.randn(200, 0, 2);
</script>

<div class="plot-container">
   <Axes limX={[-6, 6]} limY={[-5, 6]} xLabel="x" yLabel="y">

      <ScatterSeries
         xValues={x}
         yValues={y}
      />

      // x and y axis with automatic ticks and grid lines
      <XAxis slot="xaxis" />
      <YAxis slot="yaxis" />

      // box around the axes
      <Box slot="box" />

   </Axes>
</div>
```

See demo for more details.
